here we put codes that generate formulas for collapsed condition of N00N state
the files are named based on how many photons are in the N00N state:
  collaps1001 is for N00N state with 1 photon
  collaps2002 is for N00N state with 2 photon
  collaps3003 is for N00N state with 3 photon
  collaps4004 is for N00N state with 4 photon
